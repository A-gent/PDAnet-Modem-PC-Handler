# DESCRIPTION

<p align="left">
This program offers a few functionalities to pair with a PdaNet setup.
If can silently force the computer to host and upkeep a Windows Hotspot for using a computer as an access point for your PdaNet connection. This can be a weaker option for people with weaker WiFi cards though, because the quality of your WiFi card on your PdaNet-connected Windows PC will bottleneck the stability and speed of your connection. If said PC has a very good dedicated (or even onboard) WiFi card/chip, then this can be a solid choice. But the more clients / devices you have connected to your Windows Hotspot, the more the quality will degrade even if you have a very good WiFi card/chip.

I prefer to use a laptop with a Type-C port and an ethernet port as a "Modem" PC, connecting it to PdaNet, connecting the laptop via ethernet to the WAN port of a router (the modem port), and then configuring windows connection sharing of the PdaNet Broadband adapter to share its internet connection to the ethernet port, then connecting PCs directly to the router via ethernet to its LAN ports for a much more stable and fast dedicated connection. But this also serves up a much more stable and fast WiFi connection as well because you can use a router to host the network. I am using an ASUS router (RT-AC56R) to do this, and I use this modem software to autonomously upkeep 95% of issues that can occur with PdaNet in the background. The only intervention this method requires is an occasional manual reboot of the phone every 5-7 days whenever the speeds get a bit slower. When I do this reboot, I ensure to wipe the phone's cache and perform a repair apps routine in the Boot Recovery Menu of the Android phone, and this system works beautifully. Its the exact same as having a cable internet connection, as I have 5G speeds and unlimited data.

| CONFIG FILE COMMAND   |      SECTION      |  VALUE RANGE | DEFAULT VALUE | DESCRIPTION |
|-----------------------|:-----------------:|-------------:|--------------:|------------:|
| AutoHotspot |                    SWITCHES       |   0-1 |           1    |   If equals 1, runs a timer thread that executes a powershell script to force a Windows Hotspot open, and periodically re-runs that script to keep it open.<br> The time inbetween executions is configurable below.<br><br> Automatically launches a secondary timer thread that closes powershell instances left open in the background. |
| AutoConnect |                    SWITCHES       |   0-1 |           1    |   If equals 1, runs a function to check if the computer is connected to the internet currently and if it is not,<br> it will attempt to force PdaNet to reconnect to the phone.<br> (Used to ensure that when PdaNet connection disconnects randomly, it will reconnect itself.)<br> The time inbetween executions is configurable below.<br><br> *NOTE*: Will not be able to force the phone to turn PdaNet USB tethering on, though, but thankfully that is a very rare thing to turn itself off. |
| DoubleCleanupPass |              SWITCHES       |   0-1 |           1    |   If equals 1, when the AutoHotspot cleanup timer thread runs this will force the powershell process killer to do a double pass (every time it executes) to close even more instances of powershell processes running the background.<br><br> *NOTE*: This setting pertains to the secondary timer that's launched by the AutoHotspot setting that closes background powershell processes to cleanup after the AutoHotspot thread after each execution. |
| HotspotAdapterSetAutoDHCP |      SWITCHES       |   0-1                   |   1   |  This sets DHCP on the the automatic Windows Hotspot created by the AutoHotspot thread.<br><br> The target name of the Hotspot adapter can be configured under the "HotspotAdapterName" setting below. The default setting is simply the one that I use on my own PC so if you wish to use this feature you need to configure the target first.<br><br> *NOTE*: This currently is a bugged feature, though, and should not be used as of right now until I patch it or you do it yourself. |
| AutoConnectSpeed |      CONFIG                  |   USER DEFINED          | 14000 |   This is the default amount of time in miliseconds that the AutoConnect timer thread executes at.<br><br> The default time is 14000 which is 14 seconds.<br><br> *NOTE*: This time must be LESS than "AutoConnectDeleteTestSpeed" no matter what you choose to set them both to. |
| AutoConnectDeleteTestSpeed |    CONFIG          |   USER DEFINED          | 16900 |   This is the default amount of time in miliseconds that the AutoConnect test file (used to check if you are currently connected to the internet) deletion thread executes at.<br><br> This thread downloads a dummy file to test for internet connectivity.<br><br> The default time is 16900 which is 16.9 seconds.<br><br> *NOTE*: This time must be GREATER than "AutoConnectSpeed" no matter what you choose to set them both to. |
| HotspotExecSpeed |      CONFIG                  |   USER DEFINED          | 15000 |   This is the default amount of time in miliseconds that the AutoHotspot timer thread executes at.<br><br> The default time is 15000 which is 15 seconds.<br><br> *NOTE*: This time must be LESS than "HotspotCleanupSpeed" no matter what you choose to set it to.   |
| HotspotCleanupSpeed |      CONFIG               |   USER DEFINED          | 21000 |   This is the default amount of time in miliseconds that the AutoHotspot powershell process killer thread (used to close excess instances of powershell scripts left open by the AutoHotspot thread) executes at.<br><br> This thread just kills any running powershell.exe processes.<br><br> The default time is 21000 which is 21 seconds.<br><br> *NOTE*: This time must be GREATER than "HotspotExecSpeed" no matter what you choose to set them both to. |
| HotspotAdapterName |      CONFIG                |   USER DEFINED          | Local Area Connection* 14 |   This is the name of the Windows Hotspot Adapter created in your network adapters page whenever the Windows Hotspot is currently turned on.<br><br> *NOTE*: This is used by the currently bugged "HotspotAdapterSetAutoDHCP" setting. |
| HotspotAdapterDHCPbat |      CONFIG             |       N/A               |  set-DHCP.bat |   This is the name of the DHCP execution script used to automatically experimentally set DHCP on the Windows Hotspot adapter.<br><br> *NOTE*: This is tied to the "HotspotAdapterSetAutoDHCP" setting above, and is currently a bugged feature so do not use this right now. |
| Container |      PDANET                         |   USER DEFINED          | C:\Program Files (x86)\PdaNet for Android |   This is the install location of your PdaNet install folder.<br><br> If you have it installed in a non-standard location, or have a different drive letter for your system drive other than "C:\", then configure this to your current PdaNet install location.<br><br> Otherwise, you can use the default value. |
| Executable |      PDANET                        |   USER DEFINED          |   PdaNetPC.exe   |   This is the name of your PdaNet executable file. |
| DismissPdaMessages |      PDANET                |        0-1              |       1       |   If equals 1, automatically runs a timer thread to close any existing PdaNet connection error message boxes. |
| DismissMessageSpeed |      PDANET               |   USER DEFINED          |     600000    |   This is the default amount of time in miliseconds that the "DismissPdaMessages" timer thread will execute at.<br><br> The default time is 600000 which is 10 minutes. |
| AppTitleRoot |      ENGINE                      |   USER DEFINED          | Modem Handler |   This is simply the name that appears in the TrayTip message when you hover over the executable in the Windows Taskbar Tray |
| Debugger |      DEBUG                           |        0-1              |               |   This is used to debug the execution of routines within all threads and points of execution.<br> It will show messages for certain execution points / threads depending on the value of "DebuggerLevel" below.<br><br> Example: If "DebuggerLevel" = 3 then whenever the "DoubleCleanupPass" timer thread executes and clears a few If statements, then it will throw a MessageBox with information denoting that this has just occured.<br><br> If this setting equals 0, it will disable the debugger entirely and invalidate any values given under the "DebuggerLevel". |
| DebuggerLevel |      DEBUG                      |    1,<br> 2,<br> 3,<br> 4,<br> 4.1,<br> 4.2 |       1       |   If equals 1, Debugs All Main Execution Routines.<br><br> If equals 2, Debugs All Button Routines <br>(buttons found in the right click TrayMenu for the executable in the Taskbar Tray).<br><br> If equals 3, Debugs All Timer Routines.<br><br> If equals 4, Debugs The AutoConnect Timer Thread.<br><br> If equals 4.1, Debugs The AutoConnect IsInternetConnected() Function Timer Thread.<br><br> If equals 4.2, Debugs The AutoConnect DeleteDownloadTest Timer Thread.  |
